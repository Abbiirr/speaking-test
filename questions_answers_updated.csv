2,Cue card,Describe a review you read about a product or service.,"You should say:
- what you read the review about
- what information the review gave about the product or service
- and explain what you did as a result of reading this review",ielts_questions,"A science programme I found genuinely interesting was a documentary episode about **the James Webb Space Telescope** and how it studies the early universe. I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

- When: evening

- Do: walk

- Why: reset




A place I like to relax is a small park near my home. I usually go there in the evening after work, because it’s quieter and the atmosphere feels calmer. I’ll walk for twenty to thirty minutes, sometimes with music and sometimes in silence.

It helps because it creates a clear break between work mode and personal time. Even a short walk improves my mood and helps me focus when I return home.",A

I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

- Learned: docs + feedback

- Use: emails, proposals, incident summaries

- Why: less confusion, faster decisions




One useful skill I’ve learned is clear written communication, especially at work. I developed it gradually while writing documentation and project updates. At first, my messages were either too short or too detailed, so people misunderstood my point. Over time, I learned to use a simple structure: the goal first, then the decision, and finally the next steps.

Now I use this skill every day—when I explain a technical issue to someone non-technical, or when I summarise progress for a stakeholder. For example, during an incident, instead of sharing raw logs, I write a short note with impact, cause, and prevention.

It’s useful because it saves time and reduces stress. When communication is clear, teams make decisions faster and trust increases.",A

I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.",A

I had to decide quickly because both companies needed an answer within a week. To make it practical, I listed what mattered most: mentorship, real project ownership, and a team where I could ask questions without feeling judged. I also spoke to a couple of people who already worked there, so I could understand the culture beyond the job description.

In the end, I chose the more demanding role. The first few months were intense, but it paid off—I learned faster, became more confident, and built a stronger skill set.

I felt nervous at first, but now I’m glad I took the risk because it moved my career forward and made me more resilient.",A

After that conversation, I started using a simple system: I picked one “must‑finish” task for the day, blocked a focused time slot, and delayed less important requests. I also communicated my priorities clearly so people knew what I was working on.

It helped because it reduced stress and improved my output. I still get busy, but now I’m more deliberate, and I don’t panic when everything arrives at once.",A

After that, I changed how I plan. Now I break work into smaller steps, estimate each step, and add a buffer. I also communicate early if something is slipping instead of waiting until the last moment.

The lesson was simple but important: accuracy is better than optimism. A realistic plan builds trust, and it actually reduces stress in the long run.",A
