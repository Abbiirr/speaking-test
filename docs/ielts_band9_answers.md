# Band 9–style Sample Answers (for the questions above)

## Test A — Flowers and plants / Reviews / Customer service

### Part 1 — Flowers and plants

**1) Do you have a favourite flower or plant? (Why/Why not?)**  
Yes—probably the **jasmine plant**, because the scent is subtle but it instantly changes the mood of a room. Also, it’s quite low-maintenance, so even if I’m busy, it still survives.

**2) What kinds of flowers and plants grow near your home? (Why/Why not?)**  
Mostly **hardy, practical plants**—things like neem, bougainvillea, and a few seasonal flowers. The climate is warm and sometimes unpredictable, so people tend to choose plants that don’t need constant care.

**3) Is it important to you to have flowers and plants in your home? (Why/Why not?)**  
Yes, because they make the space feel **alive rather than purely functional**. Even one small pot on a desk helps me de-stress, especially after long hours of work.

**4) Have you ever bought flowers for someone else? (Why/Why not?)**  
Yes, a couple of times—usually for a birthday or to congratulate someone. It’s a simple gesture, but it communicates warmth without needing a long speech.

### Part 2 — Describe a review you read about a product or service

I recently read a detailed review of a laptop I was considering for work. I found it on a well-known tech site and also cross-checked comments on a user forum, because I wanted opinions from people who had used it for months, not just a few hours.

The product was a thin-and-light laptop with a strong processor, and the review focused on the things that actually matter day-to-day: battery performance, heating under sustained load, fan noise, and how stable the keyboard and trackpad feel for long typing sessions. What I liked was that the reviewer didn’t just list specifications—he ran real workloads, compared it with two close competitors, and was honest about trade-offs. For example, the battery was excellent for browsing, but under heavier multitasking it dropped much faster than advertised, and the laptop got noticeably warm near the palm rest.

As a result, I didn’t buy it immediately. Instead, I narrowed my options to two models and went to a store to test the keyboard and screen myself. In the end, the review saved me from an impulse purchase and helped me choose something that fits my actual routine, not just a marketing promise.

### Part 3 — Online reviews

**1) What kinds of things do people write online reviews about in your country?**  
Mostly everyday purchases—restaurants, delivery services, ride-sharing, electronics, and online shops. People also review hospitals and coaching centres, because word-of-mouth matters a lot and formal consumer protection can feel slow.

**2) Why do some people write online reviews?**  
A big reason is **to warn others**—especially if they feel cheated. On the positive side, people write reviews to reward good service and to feel that their opinion has some impact, even if it’s small.

**3) Are online reviews good for both shoppers and companies?**  
Generally yes, because shoppers reduce risk and companies get feedback they can act on. The downside is manipulation—fake reviews and “review bombing”—so the benefit depends on whether platforms verify purchases and detect patterns.

### Part 3 — Customer service

**1) What might it be like to work in a customer service job?**  
I think it’s emotionally demanding, because you deal with people when they’re already frustrated. At the same time, it can be rewarding if the company empowers staff to solve problems instead of forcing them to read scripts.

**2) Are customers more likely to complain nowadays?**  
Yes, because complaining is easier—one post can reach thousands. Expectations are also higher now: people compare service to the best experience they’ve ever had, not the average.

**3) How important is it to take complaints seriously?**  
It’s essential. Even if the customer is wrong, the complaint can reveal a broken process—like unclear pricing, late delivery, or poor communication. Handling it well protects trust and prevents small issues from becoming public reputational damage.

## Test B — Jewellery / Science TV programme / Science and the public

### Part 1 — Jewellery

**1) How often do you wear jewellery? (Why/Why not?)**  
Not often—mostly on special occasions. Day-to-day I prefer to keep it simple, because it can feel distracting when I’m working.

**2) What type of jewellery do you like best? (Why/Why not?)**  
I like **a watch** or something minimal like a ring. It’s practical, and it looks neat without being flashy.

**3) When do people like to give jewellery in your country? (Why?)**  
Usually during weddings, engagements, or big family events. Jewellery is seen as both sentimental and valuable, so it’s a way of showing respect and long-term commitment.

**4) Have you ever given jewellery as a gift? (Why/Why not?)**  
Yes, once—because it felt more meaningful than a generic present. It’s the kind of gift people keep for years, so it carries memories.

### Part 2 — Describe an interesting TV programme you watched about a science topic

A science programme I found genuinely interesting was a documentary episode about **the James Webb Space Telescope** and how it studies the early universe. I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable.

### Part 3 — Science and the public

**1) How interested are most people in your country in science?**  
I’d say curiosity is there, but it’s uneven. People engage with science when it affects daily life—health, technology, weather—but fewer people follow science as a habit unless they’re students or professionals.

**2) Why might children today be better at science than their parents?**  
They have instant access to explanations, simulations, and experiments online, so learning is less dependent on one teacher or one textbook. Also, many kids grow up using technology, which makes scientific thinking feel more familiar.

**3) How can the public learn more about scientific developments?**  
Good science communication helps—short, accurate content in local languages, and public talks that avoid jargon. Schools can also teach “how to think” rather than “what to memorise,” so people learn to evaluate claims and spot misinformation.

### Part 3 — Scientific discoveries

**1) Most important discoveries in the last 100 years?**  
I’d put **antibiotics and modern vaccines** near the top because they transformed survival rates. Then the **transistor and computing**—they reshaped everything from communication to medicine. I’d also include **medical imaging** like MRI and CT, because they changed diagnosis without invasive procedures.

**2) Do you agree there are no more major discoveries left?**  
I strongly disagree. It’s easy to think the “big discoveries” are over, but new tools create new possibilities—AI, gene editing, and materials science could unlock breakthroughs we can’t fully predict yet.

**3) Who should pay for research—governments or private companies?**  
Ideally both, with different roles. Governments should fund foundational research because it’s a public good and may take decades to pay off, while private companies can fund applied research that turns discoveries into products. The key is transparency and ethics, so commercial incentives don’t distort the science.
