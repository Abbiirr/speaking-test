## Test format (timing + flow)

The IELTS Speaking test is a **face-to-face interview** (in person or video-call at some centres) and lasts about **11–14 minutes**.

### Part 1 — Introduction & interview (≈ 4–5 minutes)
- Short questions about you and familiar topics: **home**, **family**, **work/study**, **interests**.

### Part 2 — Long turn (≈ 3–4 minutes total)
- You receive a **task card (cue card)**.
- You get **1 minute** to prepare (you can write notes).
- You speak for **up to 2 minutes**.
- Examiner may ask **1–2 short follow-up questions**.

### Part 3 — Discussion (≈ 4–5 minutes)
- More abstract questions linked to Part 2 theme.
- You explain opinions, compare, speculate, give reasons and examples.

## How Speaking is assessed (4 criteria)

You are assessed on **4 criteria** (each contributes equally):

1. **Fluency & Coherence (FC)**  
   - How smoothly you speak (speed, pausing, repetition, self-correction)  
   - How logically you connect ideas (cohesion, signposting)

2. **Lexical Resource (LR)**  
   - Range + precision of vocabulary  
   - Natural collocations, paraphrasing, and word choice

3. **Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)**  
   - Range of sentence structures (simple → complex)  
   - Accuracy (few errors, mostly error-free sentences)

4. **Pronunciation (Pron)**  
   - Intelligibility, word/sentence stress, rhythm, intonation  
   - Accent is fine as long as it does not reduce understanding

**Key point:** Examiners rate your **overall performance across the whole test**, not one answer.

## Band‑9 behaviors (what to show)

These are practical “behaviors” (not memorized phrases) that typically align with Band 8–9 performance.

### Fluency & Coherence
- Start answering immediately (no long thinking silence).
- Use **natural linking**: “Actually…”, “To be honest…”, “That said…”, “For example…”
- Develop answers fully (especially Part 2/3), but **don’t ramble**.
- If you correct yourself, do it once and move on (avoid repeated restarts).

### Lexical Resource
- Use **precise verbs**: “handle”, “manage”, “struggle with”, “prioritise”, “overlook”.
- Use **collocations**: “heavy traffic”, “work-life balance”, “a sense of achievement”.
- Paraphrase instead of repeating the same word (city → “urban area”, “metropolitan”, “downtown”).
- Use idioms *sparingly* and only if natural (“a double-edged sword”, “a game changer”).

### Grammar Range & Accuracy
- Mix structures:
  - Complex sentences with “although / whereas / while”
  - Relative clauses: “a place **where**…”
  - Conditionals: “If I had more time, I’d…”
  - Passive when needed: “It’s often overlooked…”
- Keep errors **rare**. If you’re unsure, use a simpler structure confidently.

### Pronunciation
- Prioritise clarity over speed.
- Make key words carry stress (content words).
- Use intonation to show emphasis or contrast.
- Pronounce proper nouns clearly (slow down slightly, syllable clarity).

## Answer frameworks

### Part 1 (10–25 seconds per answer)
**Framework: Direct answer → 1 reason → 1 micro-example → short close**
- Direct: “Yes, I do.” / “Not really.”
- Reason: “Because…”
- Micro-example: “For instance…”
- Close: “So it’s become a habit.”

**Upgrade moves**
- Compare “now vs past”
- Add a small detail (place/time) to sound real
- Use one flexible phrase: “It depends…”

### Part 2 (2 minutes)
**Framework A (Story): Hook → Background → Details → Reflection**
1. Hook: 1 line to set the scene
2. Background: when/where/who
3. Details: 2–3 key moments, sensory details
4. Reflection: why it mattered / what you learned

**Framework B (Topic): Definition → 3 points → Example → Personal link**
- Define the topic briefly
- Give 3 clear points
- Give a concrete example
- Relate back to you

**Timing**
- 0–20s: introduce + outline
- 20–90s: develop 2–3 points
- 90–120s: reflection + closing line

### Part 3 (30–60 seconds per answer)
**Framework: Position → 2 reasons → example → counterpoint → mini-summary**
- Position: “Overall, I think…”
- Reasons: “Mainly because…, and also…”
- Example: “For example…”
- Counterpoint: “However, I can see why…”
- Summary: “So in general…”

## Tips & tricks that actually move your score

### 1) Stop repeating your own words
Use synonyms *in context* (not fancy lists):
- “good” → “useful / effective / practical”
- “many” → “a wide range of / plenty of”
- “people” → “commuters / residents / students”

### 2) Paraphrase 10–20% even if you prepared a script
Keep the meaning, change the packaging.

### 3) Avoid memorized “IELTS phrases”
If it sounds like an essay, it will sound unnatural. Prefer short, spoken connectors.

### 4) Build answers around *examples*, not vocabulary
A small real example improves FC + LR at the same time.

### 5) Use “softeners” to sound natural
- “I’d say…”, “to some extent…”, “in my experience…”

### 6) When stuck, use a safe expansion
- “There are a couple of reasons for that…”
- “The first thing that comes to mind is…”

### 7) Don’t chase idioms
One clean collocation is better than a risky idiom.

### 8) “Band‑9 trick” for Part 3: add a counterpoint
- “On the other hand…”
- “That said, it can backfire when…”

## Common mistakes by band and upgrades

### Band 5–6 → upgrade to 6.5
Common issues
- Very short answers, limited development
- Frequent grammar errors (tense, articles, prepositions)
- Repetition of simple words (“good”, “nice”, “very”)

Upgrades
- Add **one reason + one example** every time
- Fix 5 high-frequency grammar points:
  1) past vs present perfect  
  2) articles (a/an/the)  
  3) subject–verb agreement  
  4) prepositions (in/on/at)  
  5) plural forms

### Band 6–7 → upgrade to 7.5
Common issues
- Fluency breaks: long pauses, too many fillers
- Vocabulary is okay but not precise (wrong collocations)
- Complex sentences attempted but inaccurate

Upgrades
- Practise 2-minute speaking daily (Part 2)
- Build a personal collocation bank (50 items)
- Use fewer complex sentences, but make them accurate

### Band 7–8 → upgrade to 8.5–9
Common issues
- Sounds prepared or “over-polished”
- Part 3 lacks depth: opinions without analysis
- Pronunciation is understandable but flat/monotone

Upgrades
- Add counterpoints and comparisons in Part 3
- Use stress/intonation to highlight contrast
- Replace memorised chunks with flexible phrasing

## Exam‑day strategy + recovery techniques

### Before entering
- Do a 30‑second “voice warm-up”: slow sentences + clear consonants.
- Decide your default pace: **slightly slower than your normal speed**.

### During Part 1
- Smile lightly, answer directly, expand once.
- If you mishear: “Sorry—could you repeat that, please?”

### During Part 2
- Use the 1 minute to write **keywords**, not sentences.
- Put 3 anchors on the paper: **when/where/who**, **2–3 points**, **why it matters**.

### During Part 3
- Don’t be afraid to take 1–2 seconds to think.
- Use “It depends” only if you then give 2 sides clearly.

### Recovery techniques (if you make a mistake)
- **Repair fast**: correct once and continue.
- If you lose your idea: “Let me put it another way…” and restart the point.

## Practice routines + self‑evaluation checklists

### 20‑minute daily routine
1. Part 1: 6 questions (record yourself) — 4 minutes  
2. Part 2: 1 cue card — 1 minute notes + 2 minutes talk — 3 minutes  
3. Part 3: 4 questions — 6 minutes  
4. Review recording: 7 minutes  
   - mark repetition, pauses, grammar slips

### Self‑evaluation checklist (fast)
Fluency & Coherence
- [ ] I answered immediately (no long pauses)
- [ ] I used clear linking and stayed on topic
- [ ] I gave at least one example when needed

Lexical Resource
- [ ] I avoided repeating the same word
- [ ] My word choice matched the meaning (no “big words” misuse)

Grammar
- [ ] I mixed simple + complex sentences
- [ ] Errors did not block meaning

Pronunciation (audio-only)

## Band‑9 sample answers

### Part 1 — sample answers

**Q:** Where are you from?

**A:** I’m from Dhaka, specifically the Cantonment area. It’s relatively calm compared to the city centre, with more open space and less noise, so it’s a pleasant place to come back to after a busy day.

**Q:** Do you work or are you a student?

**A:** I’m working full-time. I enjoy it because it’s problem-solving in a real context—when you improve a process, you can see the impact immediately.

**Q:** What do you do to relax?

**A:** A short walk works best for me. Even twenty minutes outside clears my head, and when I come back I feel calmer and more focused.

**Q:** Do you prefer shopping online or in stores?

**A:** Mostly online, because it saves time and lets me compare options quickly. That said, for clothes I still prefer a store, since fit and fabric are hard to judge on a screen.

**Q:** What kind of films do you like?

**A:** I tend to enjoy films with strong storytelling—either character-driven dramas or well-made thrillers. If the dialogue feels natural and the plot is tight, I’m usually interested.

**Q:** How do you practise speaking English?

**A:** I record myself, review the parts that sound unnatural, and then answer the same topic again with slightly different wording so it becomes more flexible.

### Part 2 — sample answers

**Cue card:** Describe a skill you learned that is useful.

**1‑minute notes (keywords):**

- Skill: clear written communication

- Learned: docs + feedback

- Use: emails, proposals, incident summaries

- Why: less confusion, faster decisions


**Model answer (≈2 minutes):**


One useful skill I’ve learned is clear written communication, especially at work. I developed it gradually while writing documentation and project updates. At first, my messages were either too short or too detailed, so people misunderstood my point. Over time, I learned to use a simple structure: the goal first, then the decision, and finally the next steps.

Now I use this skill every day—when I explain a technical issue to someone non-technical, or when I summarise progress for a stakeholder. For example, during an incident, instead of sharing raw logs, I write a short note with impact, cause, and prevention.

It’s useful because it saves time and reduces stress. When communication is clear, teams make decisions faster and trust increases.


**Short follow‑up:** It’s a skill I keep refining, because responsibilities grow with time.


**Cue card:** Describe a place you like to relax.

**1‑minute notes (keywords):**

- Place: small park

- When: evening

- Do: walk

- Why: reset


**Model answer (≈2 minutes):**


A place I like to relax is a small park near my home. I usually go there in the evening after work, because it’s quieter and the atmosphere feels calmer. I’ll walk for twenty to thirty minutes, sometimes with music and sometimes in silence.

It helps because it creates a clear break between work mode and personal time. Even a short walk improves my mood and helps me focus when I return home.


**Short follow‑up:** Being outdoors—even briefly—makes a noticeable difference to my stress level.


### Part 3 — sample answers

**Q:** Do you think people rely too much on smartphones?

**A:** To some extent, yes. They’re incredibly convenient, so people use them as the default tool for everything. The downside is weaker concentration and constant distraction. However, with boundaries—like limiting notifications—people can keep the benefits without becoming dependent.

**Q:** How can cities become more liveable?

**A:** Reliable transport, accessible public spaces, and affordable housing make the biggest difference. If commuting is easier, people gain time and energy. Public spaces support community life, and affordable housing reduces stress and inequality.
