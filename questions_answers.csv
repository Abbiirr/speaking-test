1,Flowers and plants,Do you have a favourite flower or plant?,,ielts_questions,"Yes—probably the **jasmine plant**, because the scent is subtle but it instantly changes the mood of a room. Also, it’s quite low-maintenance, so even if I’m busy, it still survives."
1,Flowers and plants,What kinds of flowers and plants grow near your home?,,ielts_questions,"Mostly **hardy, practical plants**—things like neem, bougainvillea, and a few seasonal flowers. The climate is warm and sometimes unpredictable, so people tend to choose plants that don’t need constant care."
1,Flowers and plants,Is it important to you to have flowers and plants in your home?,,ielts_questions,"Yes, because they make the space feel **alive rather than purely functional**. Even one small pot on a desk helps me de-stress, especially after long hours of work."
1,Flowers and plants,Have you ever bought flowers for someone else?,,ielts_questions,"Yes, a couple of times—usually for a birthday or to congratulate someone. It’s a simple gesture, but it communicates warmth without needing a long speech."
2,Cue card,Describe a review you read about a product or service.,"You should say:
- what you read the review about
- what information the review gave about the product or service
- and explain what you did as a result of reading this review",ielts_questions,"A science programme I found genuinely interesting was a documentary episode about **the James Webb Space Telescope** and how it studies the early universe. I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable."
3,Online reviews,What kinds of things do people write online reviews about in your country?,,ielts_questions,"Mostly everyday purchases—restaurants, delivery services, ride-sharing, electronics, and online shops. People also review hospitals and coaching centres, because word-of-mouth matters a lot and formal consumer protection can feel slow."
3,Online reviews,Why do some people write online reviews?,,ielts_questions,"A big reason is **to warn others**—especially if they feel cheated. On the positive side, people write reviews to reward good service and to feel that their opinion has some impact, even if it’s small."
3,Online reviews,Do you think that online reviews are good for both shoppers and companies?,,ielts_questions,"Generally yes, because shoppers reduce risk and companies get feedback they can act on. The downside is manipulation—fake reviews and “review bombing”—so the benefit depends on whether platforms verify purchases and detect patterns."
3,Customer service,What do you think it might be like to work in a customer service job?,,ielts_questions,"I think it’s emotionally demanding, because you deal with people when they’re already frustrated. At the same time, it can be rewarding if the company empowers staff to solve problems instead of forcing them to read scripts."
3,Customer service,Do you agree that customers are more likely to complain nowadays?,,ielts_questions,"Yes, because complaining is easier—one post can reach thousands. Expectations are also higher now: people compare service to the best experience they’ve ever had, not the average."
3,Customer service,How important is it for companies to take all customer complaints seriously?,,ielts_questions,"It’s essential. Even if the customer is wrong, the complaint can reveal a broken process—like unclear pricing, late delivery, or poor communication. Handling it well protects trust and prevents small issues from becoming public reputational damage."
1,Jewellery,How often do you wear jewellery?,,ielts_questions,"Not often—mostly on special occasions. Day-to-day I prefer to keep it simple, because it can feel distracting when I’m working."
1,Jewellery,What type of jewellery do you like best?,,ielts_questions,"I like **a watch** or something minimal like a ring. It’s practical, and it looks neat without being flashy."
1,Jewellery,When do people like to give jewellery in your country?,,ielts_questions,"Usually during weddings, engagements, or big family events. Jewellery is seen as both sentimental and valuable, so it’s a way of showing respect and long-term commitment."
1,Jewellery,Have you ever given jewellery to someone as a gift?,,ielts_questions,"Yes, once—because it felt more meaningful than a generic present. It’s the kind of gift people keep for years, so it carries memories."
2,Cue card,Describe an interesting TV programme you watched about a science topic.,"You should say:
- what science topic this TV programme was about
- when you saw this TV programme
- what you learnt from this TV programme about a science topic
- and explain why you found this TV programme interesting",ielts_questions,"A science programme I found genuinely interesting was a documentary episode about **the James Webb Space Telescope** and how it studies the early universe.

And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable."
3,Science and the public,How interested are most people in your country in science?,,ielts_questions,"I’d say curiosity is there, but it’s uneven. People engage with science when it affects daily life—health, technology, weather—but fewer people follow science as a habit unless they’re students or professionals."
3,Science and the public,Why do you think children today might be better at science than their parents?,,ielts_questions,"They have instant access to explanations, simulations, and experiments online, so learning is less dependent on one teacher or one textbook. Also, many kids grow up using technology, which makes scientific thinking feel more familiar."
3,Science and the public,How do you suggest the public can learn more about scientific developments?,,ielts_questions,"Good science communication helps—short, accurate content in local languages, and public talks that avoid jargon. Schools can also teach “how to think” rather than “what to memorise,” so people learn to evaluate claims and spot misinformation."
3,Scientific discoveries,What do you think are the most important scientific discoveries in the last 100 years?,,ielts_questions,"I’d put **antibiotics and modern vaccines** near the top because they transformed survival rates. Then the **transistor and computing**—they reshaped everything from communication to medicine. I’d also include **medical imaging** like MRI and CT, because they changed diagnosis without invasive procedures."
3,Scientific discoveries,Do you agree or disagree that there are no more major scientific discoveries left to make?,,ielts_questions,"I strongly disagree. It’s easy to think the “big discoveries” are over, but new tools create new possibilities—AI, gene editing, and materials science could unlock breakthroughs we can’t fully predict yet."
3,Scientific discoveries,Who should pay for scientific research — governments or private companies?,,ielts_questions,"Ideally both, with different roles. Governments should fund foundational research because it’s a public good and may take decades to pay off, while private companies can fund applied research that turns discoveries into products. The key is transparency and ethics, so commercial incentives don’t distort the science."

A place I like to relax is a small park near my home. I usually go there in the evening after work, because it’s quieter and the atmosphere feels calmer. I’ll walk for twenty to thirty minutes, sometimes with music and sometimes in silence.

It helps because it creates a clear break between work mode and personal time. Even a short walk improves my mood and helps me focus when I return home."

- Learned: docs + feedback

- Use: emails, proposals, incident summaries

- Why: less confusion, faster decisions




One useful skill I’ve learned is clear written communication, especially at work. I developed it gradually while writing documentation and project updates. At first, my messages were either too short or too detailed, so people misunderstood my point. Over time, I learned to use a simple structure: the goal first, then the decision, and finally the next steps.

Now I use this skill every day—when I explain a technical issue to someone non-technical, or when I summarise progress for a stakeholder. For example, during an incident, instead of sharing raw logs, I write a short note with impact, cause, and prevention.

It’s useful because it saves time and reduces stress. When communication is clear, teams make decisions faster and trust increases."

I watched it a few months ago on a streaming platform after seeing short clips online, and it pulled me in because it connected big ideas to real engineering challenges.

The programme explained, in a very clear way, why Webb can see things older telescopes couldn’t—mainly because it observes in infrared, and it’s positioned far from Earth to avoid heat interference. What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

What I learned wasn’t just the “wow” factor of space images, but the process behind them: how scientists interpret light spectra to figure out what distant planets are made of, and how even tiny measurement errors can change a conclusion.

I found it interesting because it balanced wonder with realism. It showed that scientific breakthroughs aren’t magic—they’re the result of patient experimentation, failure, and iteration. And honestly, it made me appreciate how science is a collaboration between imagination and discipline: you need bold questions, but you also need the engineering to make those questions testable."
